This repository archives codes written in Java that were used for benchtop tests of cavities in the lab.
During the static test, the resonant frequency of the cavity and the ambient temperature can be measured.
Whilst for the dynamic test, the emphasis is laid on the profiling of the electric field inside the cavity, from which the shunt impedance map can be derived.
Moreover, some Python codes placed under `analysis` directory serve as examples.
